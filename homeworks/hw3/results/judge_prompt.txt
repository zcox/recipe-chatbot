Example 1:
Query: Gluten-free pizza dough that actually tastes good and isn't cardboard
Recipe Response: Absolutely! Here's a delicious gluten-free pizza dough recipe that’s flavorful, tender, and never cardboard-like. It’s perfect for 2 servings.

**Gluten-Free Herb-Infused Pizza Dough**

### Ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour (with xanthan gum included, or add ½ teaspoon if not)
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- ¼ cup warm water (about 110°F/45°C)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ cup warm milk (dairy or plant-based)
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano or basil (optional for extra flavor)

### Instructions:

1. **Activate the yeast:**  
   In a small bowl, combine the warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and stir gently. Let it sit for about 5–10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This indicates the yeast is active.

2. **Mix dry ingredients:**  
   In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, salt, and dried herbs (if using). This ensures even distribution of seasonings.

3. **Combine wet ingredients:**  
   Once the yeast is frothy, add the olive oil and warm milk to the yeast mixture. Mix well.

4. **Make the dough:**  
   Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, stir everything until a sticky dough forms. It might be slightly wetter than traditional dough—this is normal for gluten-free.

5. **Knead gently:**  
   Lightly flour a clean surface with gluten-free flour and, using your hands, gently knead the dough just a few times to bring it together. If it feels too sticky, sprinkle a tiny bit more flour.

6. **Shape the crust:**  
   Transfer the dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Using damp hands, gently pat and spread the dough into a 10-inch circle or rectangle, depending on your preference. To help it stick, dampen your hands slightly.

7. **Pre-bake the crust:**  
   Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the crust for about 10 minutes until it just starts to firm up and slightly golden. This prevents sogginess once toppings are added.

8. **Add toppings and finish baking:**  
   Remove from oven, add your favorite toppings (sauce, cheese, veggies, meats). Return to the oven and bake for another 12–15 minutes until the crust is golden and crispy.

### Tips:
- For extra flavor, brush the crust with a little olive oil and garlic before adding toppings.
- Consider adding a sprinkle of grated Parmesan or a drizzle of honey in the dough for extra richness.

Enjoy your homemade gluten-free pizza with a satisfying texture and flavorful crust!
Reasoning: The recipe for Gluten-Free Herb-Infused Pizza Dough adheres to the gluten-free dietary restriction. The primary ingredient, gluten-free all-purpose baking flour, is specified to be gluten-free, and the inclusion of xanthan gum is a common practice to mimic the elasticity of gluten. The recipe does not include any wheat, barley, rye, or other gluten-containing grains. The use of warm milk is specified as either dairy or plant-based, which does not affect the gluten-free status. All other ingredients, such as olive oil, salt, sugar, yeast, and optional herbs, are naturally gluten-free. The preparation method does not introduce any gluten-containing elements. Therefore, the recipe is suitable for someone following a gluten-free diet.

Example 2:
Query: Comfort food that won't make me feel guilty
Recipe Response: I recommend making **Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken with Roasted Vegetables**. It's a comforting, flavorful dish that feels indulgent but is light and healthy. This recipe serves 2.

**Ingredients:**
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 lemon (zested and juiced)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme or rosemary
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes
- 1 zucchini, sliced
- 1 bell pepper, sliced
- 1 teaspoon oregano
- Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

**Steps:**

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon zest, lemon juice, minced garlic, olive oil, thyme/rosemary, salt, and pepper.
   - Place the chicken breasts in a zip-top bag or shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring it's well coated.
   - Seal or cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for more flavor.

2. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
   - In a mixing bowl, toss cherry tomatoes, zucchini, and bell pepper slices with a teaspoon of olive oil, oregano, salt, and pepper.
   - Spread the vegetables on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

3. **Cook the Chicken:**
   - Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.
   - Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting excess drip off.
   - Grill the chicken for 6-8 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C) and the juices run clear.
   - Transfer to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes.

4. **Roast the Vegetables:**
   - While the chicken is grilling, roast the vegetables in the oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until tender and slightly caramelized.

5. **Serve:**
   - Slice the grilled chicken into strips.
   - Plate the chicken alongside the roasted vegetables.
   - Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired.
   
This meal is light, packed with fresh flavors, and satisfying without heaviness. Enjoy!
Reasoning: The recipe response includes 'Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken with Roasted Vegetables,' which contains chicken breasts as a primary ingredient. The dietary restriction specified is vegetarian, which excludes all forms of meat, including chicken. Therefore, the inclusion of chicken in the recipe directly violates the vegetarian dietary restriction.

Example 3:
Query: Gluten-light recipe - I'm not celiac just sensitive
Recipe Response: Certainly! Here's a delicious Gluten-Light Chicken and Vegetable Stir-Fry that is flavorful, light, and perfect for a sensitive stomach.

**Gluten-Light Chicken and Vegetable Stir-Fry (Serves 2)**

**Ingredients:**
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips
- 2 tablespoons olive oil or avocado oil
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 carrot, julienned
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated
- 2 tablespoons Tamari (gluten-light soy sauce, check for gluten-free)
- 1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil (optional, for flavor)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Sesame seeds and sliced green onions for garnish (optional)

**Preparation Steps:**

1. **Prep the Ingredients:**  
Slice the chicken into thin strips, and prepare the vegetables by slicing the bell peppers, cutting the broccoli into small florets, julienning the carrot, mincing the garlic, and grating the ginger.

2. **Cook the Chicken:**  
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the sliced chicken, season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir-fry for 5-6 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and lightly browned. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.

3. **Cook the Vegetables:**  
In the same skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Toss in the garlic and ginger, sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the broccoli, bell peppers, and carrots. Stir-fry for 4-5 minutes, until the vegetables are tender but still crisp.

4. **Combine and Sauce:**  
Return the cooked chicken to the skillet with the vegetables. In a small bowl, mix the Tamari, honey, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. Pour this sauce over the chicken and vegetables. Toss everything together and cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.

5. **Serve:**  
Divide the stir-fry between two plates. Garnish with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and sliced green onions if desired. Serve hot, perhaps with a side of steamed rice or cauliflower rice for a complete meal.

Enjoy your light, flavorful, gluten-light stir-fry—a perfect balance of protein and vegetables with a savory Asian-inspired flavor!
Reasoning: The recipe is labeled as 'gluten-light,' which suggests it may not be fully gluten-free. The use of Tamari is noted as 'gluten-light soy sauce,' and while Tamari can be gluten-free, it is crucial to ensure that the specific product used is certified gluten-free. The recipe advises checking for gluten-free Tamari, which is appropriate for a gluten-sensitive individual but not strictly gluten-free without verification. Additionally, the recipe suggests serving with steamed rice, which is gluten-free, or cauliflower rice, which is also gluten-free. However, the recipe does not explicitly ensure that all ingredients are certified gluten-free, which is necessary for a strict gluten-free diet. Therefore, while the recipe may be suitable for someone who is gluten-sensitive, it does not strictly adhere to a gluten-free dietary restriction without further verification of the Tamari.

Example 4:
Query: Gluten-light recipe - I'm not celiac just sensitive
Recipe Response: Absolutely! Here's a delicious **Garlic Herb Quinoa Salad** that is light on gluten but full of flavor, perfect for a satisfying lunch or dinner for two.

### Garlic Herb Quinoa Salad (Serves 2)

#### Ingredients:
- ¾ cup quinoa
- 1 ½ cups water
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 small cucumber, diced
- ¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Optional: crumbled feta cheese or sliced olives for extra flavor

#### Instructions:

1. **Rinse the Quinoa:**
   Place the quinoa in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse thoroughly under cold running water. This removes any bitterness and ensures fluffiness.

2. **Cook the Quinoa:**
   In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and let simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Remove from heat, and let it sit covered for 5 minutes to finish steaming. Fluff with a fork.

3. **Prepare the Dressing & Vegetables:**
   While the quinoa is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, taking care not to burn it.

4. **Combine Ingredients:**
   In a large mixing bowl, add the cooked quinoa. Pour over the sautéed garlic and olive oil. Add cherry tomatoes, diced cucumber, chopped parsley, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Toss gently until well combined.

5. **Taste & Adjust:**
   Adjust seasoning as needed, adding more lemon juice, salt, or pepper according to your preference. For added richness, sprinkle with feta or olives if desired.

6. **Serve:**
   Divide the salad into two bowls or plates. Serve immediately for a fresh experience or chill in the fridge for 30 minutes to enhance flavors.

Enjoy your gluten-light, flavorful quinoa salad! It’s refreshing, healthy, and easy to prepare.
Reasoning: The recipe provided is for a Garlic Herb Quinoa Salad, which uses quinoa as the main grain. Quinoa is naturally gluten-free, making it suitable for a gluten-free diet. The other ingredients listed, such as olive oil, garlic, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, parsley, lemon juice, salt, and pepper, are also gluten-free. The optional ingredients, feta cheese and olives, are typically gluten-free as well. However, the recipe is described as 'gluten-light' rather than 'gluten-free,' which may imply that it is not strictly adhering to a gluten-free standard. Since the dietary restriction specified is 'gluten-free,' the recipe should be strictly free of gluten. The description of the recipe as 'gluten-light' suggests a potential misunderstanding of the dietary restriction, even though the ingredients themselves are gluten-free. Therefore, while the ingredients are appropriate, the labeling and description do not align with a strict gluten-free requirement.
