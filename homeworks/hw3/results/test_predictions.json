The key point is the method of preparation: the instructions involve saut\u00e9ing the onion, garlic, and spices, and simmering the carrots in broth, which involves cooking at temperatures above the raw threshold. Saut\u00e9ing and simmering typically reach temperatures that denature enzymes and eliminate raw status, thus violating the 'raw vegan' restriction.

Nonetheless, the initial cooking steps (saut\u00e9ing the aromatics and simmering the carrots) inherently involve cooking above raw temperatures. To truly be raw vegan, ingredients should be prepared without any heat surpassing 118\u00b0F (48\u00b0C), and no cooking process should be applied.
