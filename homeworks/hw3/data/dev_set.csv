You can enjoy a festive fruit cake that’s both delicious and more blood sugar-friendly by making some strategic substitutions. Here's a modified diabetic-friendly fruit cake recipe that preserves the traditional flavors but with less sugar and more nutritious ingredients.

**Diabetic-Friendly Christmas Fruit Cake (Serves 2)**

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup mixed dried fruits (such as apricots, cranberries, cherries) — reduce the sugar content of dried fruits by soaking
- ½ cup chopped nuts (almonds, walnuts, or pecans)
- ½ cup unsweetened applesauce (acts as a natural sweetener and moistener)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup almond flour
- ¼ cup coconut flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder (gluten-free if preferred)
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
- Pinch of salt
- Optional: a few drops of sugar-free or stevia-based sweetener, adjusted to taste
- Zest of 1 orange or lemon for flavor

**Preparation Steps:**

1. **Prep the dried fruits:** Since dried fruits are high in sugar, soak them overnight in hot water or unsweetened herbal tea to plump them up and reduce sugar concentration. Drain thoroughly before use.

2. **Preheat the oven:** to 325°F (160°C). Line a small loaf pan or cake tin with parchment paper to prevent sticking.

3. **Prepare the wet ingredients:** In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, applesauce, vanilla extract, and zest until smooth. The applesauce adds moisture and a touch of sweetness without spiking blood sugar.

4. **Combine dry ingredients:** In another bowl, mix almond flour, coconut flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and sweetener (if using).

5. **Mix wet and dry:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring well until you get a batter. It will be slightly thick.

6. **Add fruits and nuts:** Fold in the soaked dried fruits and chopped nuts evenly throughout the batter.

7. **Bake:** Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Bake for about 40-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

8. **Cool and serve:** Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Slice into thin pieces — about 2-3 slices per person — and enjoy a flavorful holiday treat without a major blood sugar spike.

**Tips:**  
- Pair this cake with unsweetened Greek yogurt or a cup of herbal tea for a festive, satisfying snack.

4. **Mix dry ingredients**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.

5. **Combine wet and dry**: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed or stirring with a spoon, until just combined. Be careful not to overmix — stop once everything is well incorporated.

6. **Fold in the chocolate chips**: Using a spatula, gently fold in the chocolate chips until evenly dispersed throughout the dough.

7. **Shape the cookies**: Using a tablespoon or cookie scoop, portion the dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing each cookie about 2 inches apart. Gently press down on each cookie with the back of a spoon or your fingers to slightly flatten them.

8. **Bake**: Place in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes. The cookies will look soft but should be set around the edges.

9. **Cool**: Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
