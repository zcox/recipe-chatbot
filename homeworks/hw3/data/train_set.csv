Gluten-free pizza dough that actually tastes good and isn't cardboard,gluten-free,"Absolutely! Here's a delicious gluten-free pizza dough recipe that’s flavorful, tender, and never cardboard-like. It’s perfect for 2 servings.

**Gluten-Free Herb-Infused Pizza Dough**

### Ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour (with xanthan gum included, or add ½ teaspoon if not)
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- ¼ cup warm water (about 110°F/45°C)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ cup warm milk (dairy or plant-based)
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano or basil (optional for extra flavor)

### Instructions:

1. **Activate the yeast:**  
   In a small bowl, combine the warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and stir gently. Let it sit for about 5–10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This indicates the yeast is active.

2. **Mix dry ingredients:**  
   In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, salt, and dried herbs (if using). This ensures even distribution of seasonings.

3. **Combine wet ingredients:**  
   Once the yeast is frothy, add the olive oil and warm milk to the yeast mixture. Mix well.

4. **Make the dough:**  
   Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, stir everything until a sticky dough forms. It might be slightly wetter than traditional dough—this is normal for gluten-free.

5. **Knead gently:**  
   Lightly flour a clean surface with gluten-free flour and, using your hands, gently knead the dough just a few times to bring it together. If it feels too sticky, sprinkle a tiny bit more flour.

6. **Shape the crust:**  
   Transfer the dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Using damp hands, gently pat and spread the dough into a 10-inch circle or rectangle, depending on your preference. To help it stick, dampen your hands slightly.

7. **Pre-bake the crust:**  
   Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the crust for about 10 minutes until it just starts to firm up and slightly golden. This prevents sogginess once toppings are added.

8. **Add toppings and finish baking:**  
   Remove from oven, add your favorite toppings (sauce, cheese, veggies, meats). Return to the oven and bake for another 12–15 minutes until the crust is golden and crispy.

### Tips:
- For extra flavor, brush the crust with a little olive oil and garlic before adding toppings.
- Consider adding a sprinkle of grated Parmesan or a drizzle of honey in the dough for extra richness.

Vegetarian pizza but I don't like mushrooms or bell peppers,vegetarian,"Great! Here's a delicious Vegetarian Margherita Pizza that skips mushrooms and bell peppers. It’s simple, flavorful, and perfect for two servings.

**Ingredients:**

- 1 pack of pre-made pizza dough (about 250g)
- 1/2 cup tomato sauce (preferably passata or crushed tomatoes)
- 1 cup fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced
- 1 small zucchini, thinly sliced
- 1 small red onion, thinly sliced
- A handful of cherry tomatoes, halved
- 2 fresh basil leaves, chopped
- 1-2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Optional: a pinch of dried oregano or Italian herbs

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat the Oven**  
   Set your oven to 220°C (430°F). Place a baking sheet or pizza stone inside to heat up for at least 15 minutes. This helps achieve a crispy crust.

2. **Prepare the Dough**  
   Lightly flour a clean surface and roll out the pizza dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Transfer it carefully onto a piece of parchment paper for easy handling.

3. **Add the Tomato Sauce**  
   Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the surface of the dough, leaving about 1 inch around the edges for the crust. Use a spoon to spread it gently, ensuring a thin, even layer.

4. **Arrange the Toppings**  
   Evenly distribute slices of fresh mozzarella over the sauce. Add the thin slices of zucchini and red onion. Place cherry tomato halves sporadically around the pizza for burst of sweetness.

5. **Season and Drizzle**  
   Sprinkle a pinch of salt, black pepper, and dried oregano or Italian herbs if desired. Drizzle the olive oil over the top to enhance flavor and help crust crispiness.

6. **Bake the Pizza**  
   Carefully transfer the parchment paper with the pizza onto the preheated baking sheet or stone. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and crispy, and the cheese is bubbling.

7. **Finish and Serve**  
   Remove the pizza from the oven and sprinkle with chopped basil leaves for a fresh aroma. Let it rest for a couple of minutes, then slice and enjoy!

This refreshing quinoa salad is light, nutritious, and naturally gluten-light. Perfect as a main or side dish!",True,,48_3,48,FAIL,"The recipe is labeled as 'Gluten-Light' and not explicitly 'Gluten-Free'. Quinoa is naturally gluten-free, making it suitable for a gluten-free diet. However, the recipe includes an optional ingredient, feta cheese, which is gluten-free but could be a concern if cross-contaminated during processing. The recipe does not include any gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, or rye. The preparation methods do not introduce gluten. However, since the query specifies a gluten-free dietary restriction, the use of 'gluten-light' terminology and optional ingredients that could potentially be cross-contaminated might not fully adhere to strict gluten-free standards.
